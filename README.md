# GSA_Minesweeper

Simple project created for beginners from Gamedev Students Association science Club to teach the basics of Unity Engine.

## Idea

For the next weeks we are going to create a FPS minesweeper game but without numbers indicating how many mines are on adjacent squares.

Instead of this player will be equiped with metal detector device and using sound clues to successfully clear minefield.

## Classes #1

We focused on making sure that everyone has installed Unity Editor and working intellisense in favourite IDE.

I told briefly about the Unity and gamedev basics.

## Classes #2

In this project I don't want to focus on creating assets for our game, so I visited Unity Asset Store and searched for decorations. I downloaded some free textures from another sites. And finally I created our cardboard armored player.

The sample scene looks pretty decent:

This week we focused on:

- What is `Terrain` and how to use it
- Player controller script using `New Input System`

## Classes #3 - pending

We can move around our world so its time for:

- The beginnings of gameplay
- Prefabs and dynamic minefield building
- Raycasting
